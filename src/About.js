        As a Junior Software Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree of information
        technology and a background in IT support, I have extensive experience
        working with cross-functional teams and collaborating with clients. For
        5 years I have been responsible to support and test a platform that was
        designed for making integrated applications on the web and windows with
        low code, so I am familiar with all aspects of issue tracking and
        problem-solving procedures. Since I have been working for years in a
        coding environment I had a basic idea of programming and have always
        been interested in creating applications so I started to learn
        programing using online tutorials and I realized that I love coding and
        I am improving very well so I decided to find an institute to learn how
        to code practically. I improved my technical skills through studying
        software engineering at General Assembly and collaborated in different
        projects using JavaScript, React, JQuery, Vue.js, Html/CSS, and
        RubyOnRails. The course was A highly intensive 12-week boot camp
        covering front & back end web development concepts & languages and I
        could successfully deliver a few full-stack projects from scratch. With
        group projects other than improving my coding skills I got familiar with
        the culture of working as a team member in a programming environment and
        also I gained experience with technical tools for collaboration like
        Github. Now I am familiar with both front and back end concepts of
        coding but I am more interested in Javascript and react! About my
        personality I have always been known as a persistent person which is a
        necessary feature of a developer. being in a software support role I
        learned how to find the root cause of the problems and now I have good
        problem-solving skills. Currently, I am working on my final project
        which is an e-commerce website and I used firebase for the back-end and
        react for the front-end.
